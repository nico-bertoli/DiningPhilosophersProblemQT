This project explores the implementation of the classic Dining Philosophers Problem using C++ and the Qt framework.

Two algorithms were implemented:
- Hold and wait, that demonstrates how deadlocks can occur when resources are held while waiting for others.
- Chandy/Misra algorithm, that prevents deadlocks by prioritizing resource allocation and managing ownership efficiently.
