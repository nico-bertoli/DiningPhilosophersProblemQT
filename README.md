This project explores the implementation of the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, the goal was to experiment with the QT framework and multithreading in C++.

Two algorithms were implemented:
- Hold and wait, that demonstrates how deadlocks can occur when resources are held while waiting for others.
- Chandy/Misra algorithm, which prevents deadlocks by prioritizing resource allocation and managing ownership efficiently.
